I&amp;rsquo;m FatherFireball - techie, streamer, and all around nerd. I&amp;rsquo;ve streamed on and off for about 6 years now in addition to being a husband and cat dad.
I play lots of things both on and off stream - Metroidvanias, Soulsborne games, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, Rocket League, and more. I hope to entertain and keep everything light to give everyone a relaxing space to come chill.
As for the blog I want to share the streaming things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years and random thoughts as well.</description><content>&lt;p>Hey y&amp;rsquo;all!

&lt;p>As for the blog I want to share the streaming things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years and random thoughts as well. Game reviews, game design talks, D&amp;amp;D characters, the list goes on&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ll be flexing the creative writing muscles and tackling a variety of subjects ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you out there! o7&lt;/p>
