Hey y'all! I'm FatherFireball - techie, streamer, and all around nerd. I've streamed on and off for about 6 years now in addition to being a husband and cat dad. 

I play lots of things both on and off stream - Metroidvanias, Soulsborne games, Dungeons & Dragons, Rocket League, and more. I hope to entertain and keep everything light to give everyone a relaxing space to come chill.

As for the blog I want to share the streaming things I've learned over the years and random thoughts as well. Game reviews, game design talks, D&D characters, the list goes on... we'll be flexing the creative writing muscles and tackling a variety of subjects ðŸ˜Š

See you out there! o7
