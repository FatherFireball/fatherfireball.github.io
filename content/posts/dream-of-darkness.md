new take on the stereotypical rogue, and giving them more than the regular jackassery of "my chaotic ebil would do it"
maybe multi as a rogue/pally
BUT
the key is that the rogue worships Tharizdun, CE god of eternal darkness
their primary devotion is driving them to be the antithesis of Pholtus, LG god of light
their mission, destroy all that worship and work in the light
Creed: From nothingness we came, and to nothingness you shall return
oh yeah, forgot my inspo for the rogue
