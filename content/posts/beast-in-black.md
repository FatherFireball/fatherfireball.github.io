# >> CHARACTER BACKSTORY



# >> DMS

here's one i've been holding that isn't necessarily tied to anything yet, but could call it the beast in black build. aasimar rogue that earned it's name for being the patron of Death, grim reaper build go brrrrr
aasimar with black clothes, black wings, bigass scythe
for extra fun, add in a plague doc mask
campaign setting in medieval euro
plague rampant
The Beast in Black was known for reaping the souls of those afflicted with the Rot...
speaking of DD, another fun build popped in my head: companion to the beast in black, the plague doctor. alchemist that intentionally cultivates the Rot in order to give the aasimar targets to kill
could play like a spore queen druid
i really like the idea of the aasimar and plague doc being paired up
Idea for an intro to that char
X-vs-1 party hunt/recruitment
Your party is tasked with stopping "the reaper", a mysterious figure that's been plaguing the countryside by culling those who oppose their deity
Culminates in a party vs party showdown where ending it is either the patron taking pity on defeated party or recognizing their strength
