# >> CHARACTER BACKSTORY

# >> DMS

haven't quite fleshed this one out, maybe a wizard or bard, but
came from a line from denzel curry: "Sorrow is streamlined into story"
https://open.spotify.com/track/3rMQe2is2UAxuhtFjRyYyz?si=2c2cc08d74c24f64
anyways, the idea
i want the character to be a self-proclaimed investigative journalist. less concerned with combat, but heavily invested in the people of the republic and the trials and tribulations they face
