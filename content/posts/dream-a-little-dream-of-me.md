grew up in poverty, war torn lands - devoted themselves to the circle of dreams as an escape, related to their PTSD. all of their skills around surviving, using them to survive and escape
much more centered and loyal than some of the other characters i've sent
they keep the bonds of those around them close at heart, holding them above both authority and even their own goals
ultimate goal is secretly a sinister one - they want to induce a dream that encompasses the entire world, halting conflict
and ultimately ending the war the forced them into being a refugee
