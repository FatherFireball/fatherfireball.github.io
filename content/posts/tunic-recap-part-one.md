# >> INTRO

Hey all! We recently started a playthrough of [TUNIC](https://tunicgame.com/), a isometric puzzle adventure Soulslike created by [Dicey](https://twitter.com/dicey) and published by Finji. The TL;DR on what to expect is just as vague as the game itself - "Explore a land filled with lost legends, ancient powers, and ferocious monsters in TUNIC, an isometric action game about a small fox on a big adventure." I'm streaming the adventure on YouTube and the VODs should stay up there, so if you want to skip the text and just watch, it's below!

The screen pans in, revealing a beautifully crafted isometric world, zooming and zooming... until we eventually find our main character, asleep on the beach. After taking some time to myself to feel out the controls, we begin the adventure and unraveling the mysteries of the island. First up - a golden platform. Button mashing doesn't seem to provide anything and I decide that we can't do anything with it. I cross the bridge it lies on and find a house with a mailbox nearby. Inspecting the mailbox brings up the first mystery...

What does that even _MEAN_?
