came from the title of this one
femme fatale deception-based rogue, HOWEVER
the key here is that I really really really want there to be some lore or game mechanic that allows her to fulfill her purpose in my head - she's obsessed with stealing the people's souls that she kills
think courtesan rogue on steroids
