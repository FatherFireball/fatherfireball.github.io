# >> CHARACTER BACKSTORY

# >> DMS

this one - a human male who lost his family at a young age. in an attempt to bring them back, tapped into necromancy before realizing what it really was and went partially insane
calling it the jekyll & hyde build
effectively this guy is somewhat normal now, mid 30's suave man, wears suit vests and gorgeous clothes
not gaudy, just....sexy
but
when provoked into anger/threatened, he takes on the madness and taps into his necromancy
think channeling his inner heath ledger
nothing is off limits when he's in that headspace
