you're gonna die when you hear this
........drug dealer bard. loser got kicked out of his parents, all he has is his lute
and the drugs
ðŸ˜‚
no real direction for life, figures he can jam with these adventurers and maybe sell some dope on the side to some suckers
kicker: he's only ever sold to his friends and thinks he's HARD
but in reality he's just some chumpy kid
inspo: "it's funny how i see everything more straight when i'm bent"
