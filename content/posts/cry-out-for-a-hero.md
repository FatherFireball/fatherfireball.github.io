# >> CHARACTER BACKSTORY



# >> DMS

So I had another character idea and I'm sending this to you partly to keep it in my brain
I'm doing it this way because I'm using voice to text while driving
But
The idea
So this came from one of the songs I was listening to but I thought of a character who comes from royalty but thinks that he's read too many hero tales and therefore things to that he is the savior of the Earth
Specifically this came from beast in black their song cry out for a hero
