So, another character idea
https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTd39YJVf/?k=1
check out tank's profile - he does a viking theme
anyways, shield viking with hatchet, stereotypical valhalla-bound warrior, fights for teh glory of battle itself
idea came from brothers of metal - ride of valkyries and tank's account lol
