# >> CHARACTER BACKSTORY



# >> DM TO BUBS

Backstory: homelands were a peaceful land, kind gentle folk - mostly druids and the like
-> Mountain area
A neighboring nation's corporation moved in, at first everything was alright - mutual benefit
As things moved along, the corporation started taking more and more and more from the land, completely destroying and draining it
-> Resource: "world essence", corporation calls it "aether mechanica" - refining it to produce magic-infused goods
Finally the people revolted, but it was too late - they were crushed by the corporation's security forces
In a last act of desparation, the people banded together to burn their homeland along with the corporation and became wandering nomads
The last remnants of this group formed a coalition to effectively wander and perform hit strikes on similar corporations and military groups
The barbarian is the last remaining member
I am the storm that is approaching / Provoking black clouds in isolation / I am reclaimer of my name
